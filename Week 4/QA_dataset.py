# ## 1 - Extractive Question Answering
# 
# Question answering (QA) is a task of natural language processing that aims to automatically answer questions. The goal of *extractive* QA is to identify the portion of the text that contains the answer to a question. For example, when tasked with answering the question 'When will Jane go to Africa?' given the text data 'Jane visits Africa in September', the question answering model will highlight 'September'.
# 
# * You will use a variation of the Transformer model you built in the last assignment to answer questions about stories.
# * You will implement extractive QA model in TensorFlow and in PyTorch.
# 
# **Recommendation:**
# * If you are interested, check out the [Course 4: Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp/home/welcome) of our [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing?=) where you can learn how to build Transformers and perform QA using the [Trax](https://trax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library.

# ### 1.1 - Data preprocessing
# 
# Run the following cell to load the [QA bAbI dataset](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/), which is one of the bAbI datasets generated by Facebook AI Research to advance natural language processing.

# In[1]:


from datasets import load_from_disk

# Load a dataset and print the first example in the training set
babi_dataset = load_from_disk('data/')
print(babi_dataset['train'][0])


# Take a look at the format of the data. For a given story, there are two sentences which serve as the context, and one question. Each of these phrases has an ID. There is also a supporting fact ID which refers to a sentence in the story that helps answer the question. For example, for the question 'What is east of the hallway?', the supporting fact 'The bedroom is east of the hallway' has the ID '2'. There is also the answer, 'bedroom' for the question.

# In[2]:


babi_dataset['train'][102]


# Check and see if the entire dataset of stories has this format.

# In[3]:


type_set = set()
for story in babi_dataset['train']:
    if str(story['story']['type'] )not in type_set:
        type_set.add(str(story['story']['type'] ))


# In[4]:


type_set


# To make the data easier to work with, you will flatten the dataset to transform it from a dictionary structure to a table structure.

# In[5]:


flattened_babi = babi_dataset.flatten()


# In[6]:


flattened_babi


# In[7]:


next(iter(flattened_babi['train']))


# Now it is much easier to access the information you need! You can now easily extract the answer, question, and facts from the story, and also join the facts into a single entry under 'sentences'.

# In[8]:


def get_question_and_facts(story):
    dic = {}
    dic['question'] = story['story.text'][2]
    dic['sentences'] = ' '.join([story['story.text'][0], story['story.text'][1]])
    dic['answer'] = story['story.answer'][2]
    return dic


# In[9]:


processed = flattened_babi.map(get_question_and_facts)


# In[10]:


processed['train'][2]


# In[11]:


processed['test'][2]


# The goal of extractive QA is to find the part of the text that contains the answer to the question. You will identify the position of the answer using the indexes of the string. For example, if the answer to some question was 'September', you would need to find the start and end string indices of the word 'September' in the context sentence 'Jane visits Africa in September.'
# 
# 
# Use this next function to get the start and end indices of the answer in each of the stories in your dataset.

# In[12]:


def get_start_end_idx(story):
    str_idx = story['sentences'].find(story['answer'])
    end_idx = str_idx + len(story['answer'])
    return {'str_idx':str_idx,
          'end_idx': end_idx}


# In[13]:


processed = processed.map(get_start_end_idx)


# In[14]:


num = 187
print(processed['test'][num])
start_idx = processed['test'][num]['str_idx']
end_idx = processed['test'][num]['end_idx']
print('answer:', processed['test'][num]['sentences'][start_idx:end_idx])

# ### 1.2 - Tokenize and Align with ðŸ¤— Library
# 
# Now you have all the data you need to train a Transformer model to perform Question Answering! You are ready for a task you may have already encountered in the Named-Entity Recognition lab - tokenizing and aligning your input. To feed text data to a Transformer model, you will need to tokenize your input using a [ðŸ¤— Transformer tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer.html). It is crucial that the tokenizer you use must match the Transformer model type you are using! In this exercise, you will use the ðŸ¤— [DistilBERT fast tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/distilbert.html), which standardizes the length of your sequence to 512 and pads with zeros. 

# Transformer models are often trained by tokenizers that split words into subwords. For instance, the word 'Africa' might get split into multiple subtokens. This can create some misalignment between the list of tags for the dataset and the list of labels generated by the tokenizer, since the tokenizer can split one word into several, or add special tokens. Before processing, it is important that you align the start and end indices with the tokens associated with the target answer word with a `tokenize_and_align()` function. In this case, since you are interested in the start and end indices of the answer, you will want to align the index of the sentence to match the index of the token for a word. 
# 

# In[15]:


from transformers import DistilBertTokenizerFast
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('tokenizer/')


# In[16]:


def tokenize_align(example):
    encoding = tokenizer(example['sentences'], example['question'], truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=tokenizer.model_max_length)
    start_positions = encoding.char_to_token(example['str_idx'])
    end_positions = encoding.char_to_token(example['end_idx']-1)
    if start_positions is None:
        start_positions = tokenizer.model_max_length
    if end_positions is None:
        end_positions = tokenizer.model_max_length
    return {'input_ids': encoding['input_ids'],
          'attention_mask': encoding['attention_mask'],
          'start_positions': start_positions,
          'end_positions': end_positions}


# In[17]:


qa_dataset = processed.map(tokenize_align)


# In[18]:


qa_dataset = qa_dataset.remove_columns(['story.answer', 'story.id', 'story.supporting_ids', 'story.text', 'story.type'])


# In[19]:

# ### 2.1 - TensorFlow implementation
# For this assignment you will execute two implemenations, one in TensorFlow and one in PyTorch.
# 
# 
# 

# 
# #### Train and test datasets
# 
# **Note:**
# * In the TensorFlow implementation, you will have to set the data format type to tensors, which may create ragged tensors (tensors of different lengths). 
# * You will have to convert the ragged tensors to normal tensors using the `to_tensor()` method, which pads the tensors and sets the dimensions to `[None, tokenizer.model_max_length]` so you can feed different size tensors into your model based on the batch size.  

# In[22]:


import tensorflow as tf

columns_to_return = ['input_ids','attention_mask', 'start_positions', 'end_positions']

train_ds.set_format(type='tf', columns=columns_to_return)

train_features = {x: train_ds[x].to_tensor(default_value=0, shape=[None, tokenizer.model_max_length]) for x in ['input_ids', 'attention_mask']}
train_labels = {"start_positions": tf.reshape(train_ds['start_positions'], shape=[-1,1]),
                'end_positions': tf.reshape(train_ds['end_positions'], shape=[-1,1])}


train_tfdataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_features, train_labels)).batch(8)


# #### Training 
# 
# It is finally time to start training your model! 
# 
# * Create a custom training function using [tf.GradientTape()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/GradientTape)
# * Target two loss functions, one for the start index and one for the end index. 
# * `tf.GradientTape()` records the operations performed during forward prop for automatic differentiation during backprop. 
# 

# In[23]:

for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    print("Starting epoch: %d"% epoch )
    for step, (x_batch_train, y_batch_train) in enumerate(train_tfdataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            answer_start_scores, answer_end_scores = model(x_batch_train)
            loss_start = loss_fn1(y_batch_train['start_positions'], answer_start_scores)
            loss_end = loss_fn2(y_batch_train['end_positions'], answer_end_scores)
            loss = 0.5 * (loss_start + loss_end)
        losses.append(loss)
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_weights)
        opt.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_weights))

        if step % 20 == 0:

# Take a look at your losses and try playing around with some of the hyperparameters for better results!

# You have successfully trained your model to help automatically answer questions! Try asking it a question about a story.

# Congratulations! You just implemented your first QA model in TensorFlow. 

# <a name='2-1'></a>
# ## 2.2 PyTorch implementation
# 
# [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab that can be used for computer vision and natural language processing. As you can imagine, it is quite compatible with the bAbI dataset.

# #### Train and test dataset
# 
# Go ahead and try creating a train and test dataset by importing PyTorch.

# In[26]:


from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

columns_to_return = ['input_ids','attention_mask', 'start_positions', 'end_positions']
train_ds.set_format(type='pt', columns=columns_to_return)
test_ds.set_format(type='pt', columns=columns_to_return)


# For the accuracy metrics for the PyTorch implementation, you will change things up a bit and use the [F1 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html) for start and end indicies over the entire test dataset as the loss functions. 

# In[27]:


from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

def compute_metrics(pred):
    start_labels = pred.label_ids[0]
    start_preds = pred.predictions[0].argmax(-1)
    end_labels = pred.label_ids[1]
    end_preds = pred.predictions[1].argmax(-1)
    
    f1_start = f1_score(start_labels, start_preds, average='macro')
    f1_end = f1_score(end_labels, end_preds, average='macro')
    
    return {
        'f1_start': f1_start,
        'f1_end': f1_end,
    }


# #### Training
# 
# Now it is time to load a pre-trained model. 
# 
# **Note:** You will be using the DistilBERT instead of TFDistilBERT for a PyTorch implementation.
